Since child processes make copies of parent process components, when child is forked
it inherits a copy of the file descriptor. 
Meaning whatever is done with the file descriptor remains unaffected
for the parent process.
If the descriptor is closed in child, it will only close for the child but not for
the parent and vice versa.
